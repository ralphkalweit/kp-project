## Golang

The most important parts of the Scala 3 code have also been implemented in Golang (Go). This allows for a comparison of the functional programming capabilities of Scala 3 and Go.
The best way to understand the code is to read it! The tests should be very informative.

### Setup your environment
Follow the [official instructions](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) to set up a go environment, and you should be good to "go" (e.g. execute code, run tests, debug).

All go code is inside `./go`. To continue in the console, please run `cd go`.

I recommend to use Goland from IntelliJ. If you don't want that, you can run the tests using `go test ./sudoku` or start the main with `go run ./cmd`.
